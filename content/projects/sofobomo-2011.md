Here is the blurb of the book:

> __Senigallia Cemetery. The Old Part.__

It covers the slopes of one of the hills that surround the town and walking trough its rows is of visual and historic interest. This book is a photographic journey in the old part of the Senigallia cemetery, presented through four visual themes: colombarium, gates, flowers and plants, decorations. Parallel texts: English and Italian.
