Second assignment of [Data Analysis course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis),
November 2013 edition.

<!--more-->
The data for this assignment are the Samsung activity data available from the
[course website](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/dataanalysis/samsungData.rda).
These data are slightly processed to make them easier to load into R.

You can also find the raw data here:

<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>

The task is to build a function that predicts what activity a subject is performing
based on the quantitative measurements from the Samsung phone. For this analysis
your training set must include the data from subjects 1, 3, 5, and 6.
But you may use more subjects data to train if you wish. Your test set is the data
from subjects 27, 28, 29, and 30, but you may use more data to test. Be careful
that your training/test sets do not overlap.
