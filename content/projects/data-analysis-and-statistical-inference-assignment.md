Access to education and its funding is the subject of many discussions on social
mobility and redistribution of income. The study explores data from a long running
social survey to verify one of the main topic of these discussions: if family
income is related to education level.

The study uses [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www3.norc.org/gss+website/)
data for the year 2012.
