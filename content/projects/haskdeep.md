[HaskDeep](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskdeep "haskdeep on hackagedb")
is a command line tool, written in Haskell, that computes file hashes traversing
recursively through a directory structure.
Known hashes are saved to file and they can be used to verify the original files
or a copy of them.
