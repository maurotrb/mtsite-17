      <description>In my experience, people get far more excited about doing something as well as it can be done than about doing something adequately. If they are working in an environment where excellence is expected, then they will do excellent work without anything but self-motivation. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about an environment in which excellence is noticed and respected and is in the culture. If you have that, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to tell people to do excellent work.</description>
