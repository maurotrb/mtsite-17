      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-mooc-on-writing-from-mt-san-jacinto-college&#34;&gt;A MOOC on writing from Mt. San Jacinto College&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From June to July 2014, I followed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/course/basicwriting&#34;&gt;Crafting an Effective Writer&lt;/a&gt;
a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course&#34;&gt;MOOC&lt;/a&gt; from Mt. San Jacinto College.
The course goal is &amp;ldquo;to become an effective builder of sentences using the basic
tools of grammar, punctuation, and writing&amp;rdquo;. It is designed for American high school
and college students, but even for global community members. I recommend it to
anyone who wants to become a better writer. A new session will be available in September 2014.

      <description>Of all the barriers to change &amp;ndash; and to realizing the benefits of plain language &amp;ndash; none is greater than the myth that clarity has to be sacrificed for precision, especially with complex subjects. Don&amp;rsquo;t believe it. The murkiness that plagues so much official and legal prose is usually generated by the writer, not by the substance. It comes more from bad style than from the inherent difficulty of the subject.</description>
